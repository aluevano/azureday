# Activating a Free Azure Pass
The free Azure pass you have been given gives you up to $100 to spend on Azure resources. It expires when either, you have consumed all $100 or 30 days have passed

Please follow these instructions **ABSOLUTELY TO THE LETTER**. Please read each step twice, before you do it. This is important: itâ€™s possible to lock yourself out of your free subscription or create scenarios where the pass *"is already in use"* or *"pass is not associated with this account"* and many other similar error messages & problems

If you follow these instructions **TO THE LETTER WITH NO STEPS SKIPPED OR ALTERNATIVE STEPS TAKEN** then you will have success. The process will take less than 5 minutes
